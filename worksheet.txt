Q1: What are the 3 commands to transfer something from your local codebase to GitHub?
git add .
git commmit -m "message"
git push

Q2: What does 'git clone' do? 
git clone creates a local copy of a central repository on your own computer so that you can edit the code in the repository.

Q3: What does 'git status' do?
git status shows the differences between the changes made on your local repo and the central repo.

Q4: What does "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'" tell you?
"Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'" tells you that as of your last fetch no commits have been made to master branch in either the local or central repository.

Q5: You’ve made a change to a file in GitHub, the one on the browser, and now you run 'git status' on the terminal. It still says "Up to Date" despite the change. What command do you need to enter first?
git fetch

Q6: You’ve just ran the 'rm' command and deleted an important file. All your code is deleted, not including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit' before the rogue command. Is your code saved?
No, since you never pushed your changes to the central repository.

Q7: Your computer crashes and all your code is deleted, including the local repository. You only ran 'git add' and 'git commit'. Is your code saved?
While you do have a backup of your previously pushed commits on GitHub, the edits you made in the most recent commit were not saved since you did not push the changes.
